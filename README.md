# Notes for reviewer(s)
* I have tested in Chrome and not concerned myself with very small viewport sizes or other browsers.
* I assume that we have only American English speakers viewing this product.
* Optimizations are made for speed, network usage, and readability. Small amount of extra memory is used to keep things readable and understandable. You can search for "OPTIMIZATION:" in `App.js` to see where/how I chose to optimize.
